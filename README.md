# E-Book-to-PDF-Converter

Make sure you have Python, Pillow and PyAutoGUI installed.

If you want a custom first page (such as a cover page) of the textbook, include it in the root folder of this directory. Otherwise, simply type default.png when prompted, as a first page image file is provided in the directory.

To run the program, open a command prompt, navigate to the root folder of this directory, and enter:
`python -i main.py"`

The final output file will be called "outputPDF.pdf" and it will be located in the root folder of the directory.
